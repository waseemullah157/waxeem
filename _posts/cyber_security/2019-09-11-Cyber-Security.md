As a software developer I'm often asked about hacking, and they insist me to help them to hack the profile of their friends. Often their expectations are unrealistic because usually they are not aware of the science behind hacking. For most people hacking is like magic and hacker is magician, and often such people are victim of evil hackers.

Here in this article I’ll try t explain the science behind hacking, which will help both normal person and people who are interested in hacking and are willing to invest their time and money in it. 

Few decades back when computer software and hardware was not advance hacking was so easy and was over popular. In those days it was very easy to manipulate the computer systems. However, by time hardware and software are updated, and now world of hacking is different.

This doesn’t mean hacking is impossible. In every security system we make the security breach difficult by taking measures, but we can’t make it impossible. Whatever the target of hacker is, it must have some hack value. Which is benefit which hacker gain after successful attack. But in order to get this hack value he must invest his time and money. Efficient security is when hacker’s investment is greater then hack value. In that way it will be useless for hackers.
