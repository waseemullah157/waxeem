As a software developer I'm often asked about hacking, and my friends insist me to help them to hack the profiles of their friends. Often their expectations are unrealistic because usually they are not aware of the science behind hacking. For most people hacking is like magic and hacker is magician, and often such people are victim of evil hackers.

Here in this article I’ll try to explain the science behind hacking, which will help both normal person and people who are interested in hacking and are willing to invest their time and money in it. After reading this article you will be aware of the intentions of evil hackers and you will also be able to save your privacy, time and money.

Few decades back when computer software and hardware was not advance hacking was so easy and was very popular. In those days it was very easy to manipulate the computer systems. However, by time hardware and software are upgraded, and now world of hacking is different and difficult. However any security system can enhanced to make the potential breach difficult, but it can't make impossible.

## Whats the catch then? How to achieve security?

Whatever the target of hacker is, it must have some hack value. Which is benefit which hacker gain after successful attack. But in order to get this hack value he must invest his time and money. Efficient security is when hacker’s investment is greater then hack value. In that way it will be useless for hackers to manipulate the system. 

## Research and Development in Hacking

Usually common men encounter the hacker who is expert in using already developed hacking tools. These tools are developed with heavy research and development which is conducted by different parties, some are open source and some are confidential. Confidentially developed tools are kept by intelligence agencies and main stream evil hackers.

Every piece of software you download or install your system can potentially compromise your system.
